API testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of applications. Here are 9 types of API testing you should know about:

1. Functional Testing: Verifying the functionality of individual API endpoints.
1. Load Testing: Assessing how well an API handles different levels of traffic.
1. Security Testing: Identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring data protection.
1. Interoperability Testing: Testing the compatibility of APIs with various systems and platforms.
1. Validation Testing: Validating responses against predefined expectations.
1. Negative Testing: Checking the API's behavior under unexpected or invalid inputs.
1. Stress Testing: Evaluating performance under extreme conditions to ensure stability.
1. Reliability Testing: Testing for consistency and reliability over time.
1. Automated Testing: Streamlining testing processes with automation tools and frameworks.
