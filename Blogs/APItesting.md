API testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of applications. Here are 9 types of API testing you should know about:

1️⃣ Functional Testing: Verifying the functionality of individual API endpoints.
2️⃣ Load Testing: Assessing how well an API handles different levels of traffic.
3️⃣ Security Testing: Identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring data protection.
4️⃣ Interoperability Testing: Testing the compatibility of APIs with various systems and platforms.
5️⃣ Validation Testing: Validating responses against predefined expectations.
6️⃣ Negative Testing: Checking the API's behavior under unexpected or invalid inputs.
7️⃣ Stress Testing: Evaluating performance under extreme conditions to ensure stability.
8️⃣ Reliability Testing: Testing for consistency and reliability over time.
9️⃣ Automated Testing: Streamlining testing processes with automation tools and frameworks.
